package captChanInfo
# This package provides the mapping between electronics channels and
# the geometry objects.  This is required by all of the software to
# map DAQ files into calibrated files, so it must be kept stable.  As
# much as possible, backward compatibility must be maintained.  Please
# contact the package manager before making changes.  In particular,
# contact the package manager before designing (or especially
# implementing) any structural changes so we can make sure that all of
# the impacts of the change are understood by the entire group.  A new
# stable version should be created before significant changes are
# made.  Email enquiries should be directed to
# captain-sw@simpa.lbl.gov.
