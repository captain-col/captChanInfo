# This file contains a set of wires identified by the plane and wire
# number that should be ignored in both data and MC.  There should be
# one wire to be ignored on each line, the first column is the plane
# number, and the second column is the wire number.  The plane and
# wire number uses the conventions of CaptGeomId.hxx.

# NOTE: This could quite reasonably be saved as a data base table, but
# since miniCAPTAIN has a very limited time period, the same wires
# need to be eliminated in both data and the corresponding MC, and the
# control sample used to determine the ignored wires come from the
# entire data period, it's been put into a single file.  The
# TChannelCalib interface to this [IsGoodWire()] still assumes that
# the list of wires might change with every run, so this can be
# "fixed" in the future if it turns out to be necessary.
